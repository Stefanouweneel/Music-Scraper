# Music Hackathon Project

###INFO

A scraper using the Nokogiri gem to retrieve artist data from different pages. The data will be added as a bookmark so that the user can keep track of his or her favourite artists. This hackathon project was created in 2 days. On [this page](https://intense-basin-22468.herokuapp.com/) you can find an example hosted on Heroku. 

Cool stuf we learned from this project include: 
- Using Nokogiri and Net HTTP to scrape data as effective as possible
- Validate if data is present inside the view
- Using the Materialize parallax view
