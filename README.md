# Music Scraper

A project made in 2 days with a group of 4 during a Hackathon at Codaisseur.

The concept was to create a website that would gather information about the favourite artists of a user in one location.

We used the Nokogiri gem to allow us to scrape CSS elements from external sources. We implemented the Twitter gem to scrape Twitter feeds of artists. We used Materialise for the front-end.
